Data analysis of exchange rate versus cross rate for Danish krone (DKK) - Euro, US dollars, Pounds sterling, Japanese yen.
We will visualize exchange rate and cross rate dynamics using charts.
As a result of high-level analysis, we will determine:
-	For each currency
    > when it had the highest depreciation against Danish krone (the lowest historical value in a dataset)
    > when it had the highest appreciation against Danish krone (the highest historical value in a dataset)
    > when it had the biggest depreciation and appreciation in one day (extreme fall in the value)
    > when it had the biggest depreciation and appreciation in one day (extreme growth in the value)
